# Exercise 1: Creating data frames

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks scored in the first 4 games of their season
# Hint: (google "Seahawks scores")
scored <- c(9, 12, 27, 46)

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks have allowed to be scored against them in the first 4 games
allowed <- c(17, 9, 33, 18)

# Combine your two vectors into a dataframe
my.data <- data.frame(scored, allowed)

# Create a new column "diff" that is the difference in points
my.data$diff <- abs(scored - allowed)

# Create a new column "won" which is TRUE if the Seahawks wom
my.data$won <- (scored > allowed)

# Create a vector of the opponents
opponents <- c('Packers','49ers','Titans','Colts')

# Assign your dataframe rownames of their opponents
my.data$opp <- opponents
